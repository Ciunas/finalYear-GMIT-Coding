The goal in developing this game was to demonstrate a multithreaded server that could process multiple connections from clients at the same time. The server in the example is really a mediator between the two client appletsâ€”it makes sure that each move is valid and that each client moves in the proper order. The server does not determine who won or lost or if there was a draw. Also, there is no capability to allow a new game to be played or to terminate an existing game.

The following is a list of modifications that is required to the multithreaded server and client:

a) Modify the TicTacToeServer class to test for a win, loss or draw on each move in the game. Send a message to each client applet that indicates the result of the game when the game is over.

b) Modify the TicTacToeClient class to display a button that when clicked allows the client to play another game.

The button should be enabled only when a game completes.

Note that both classes TicTacToeClient and class TicTacToeServer must be modified to reset the board array and program state varibales.

Also, the other TicTacToeClient should be notified that a new game is about to begin so its board and state can be reset.

The first client to activate the "new game" button should be allocated 'X'.
